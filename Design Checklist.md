# Design Checklist
This checklist is meant to facilitate design reviews by providing reviewers and designers alike with a short, manageable list of commonly overlooked elements of good Onshape designs.

Date checked:     
Checker:

- [] All parts and features are named appropriately
- [] Every line in every sketch is fully constrained (nothing is blue!)
- [] Part instancing only happens at the assembly level - NOT within a Part Studio
- [] Complex assemblies are "reasonably chunked" into multiple Part Studios
- [] Configuration variables have reasonable ranges across which the model always builds *pretty well*
- [] All measurements are set using the "Variable" too found [here.](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/78aa66ffe6f1daceb9cfad3d/v/944415a6695f45790aeea4c6/e/1ec09e0e6fb8aa4f8ff957b1)
